<h3 id="website-construction">Website construction</h3>
<p>During the master&rsquo;s study, when facing various difficulties in finding various learning materials, I can always break into the blogs of some professional bigwigs. The blog posts are rich in content and the web pages are cool. I would like to thank them for providing them for my study. help. Is also influenced by the big brothers,I also have the idea of building a blog. After all, I have to keep up with the big guys and find a platform for publicity. Without a platform, do it yourself. However, due to lack of time and ability, I tried a few times without success. Recently, the boss set up a task to build a website for the laboratory, which forced me to return to my old business and continue to explore the web building process. Through continuous search for information, finally experiment,The website of the room was built, but it was deployed on other platforms. I originally wanted to use github to deploy the webpage. Until today, the problem of the messy rendering format of the webpage theme was not solved. I wasn’t easy either. I always wanted to deploy through github, but after a few days of hard work, the website was built, and suddenly I found that github deployment was OK, The code is so amazing, maybe your confusion is the difference between Chinese and English punctuation. Of course, the garbled github deployment format is not a punctuation problem. Hereby write a blog post to commemorate the success of the webpage construction.</p>
